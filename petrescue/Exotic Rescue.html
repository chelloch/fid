<h2>Welcome to the Exotic Pet Rescue!</h2>
<p>Many people adopt animals and find they do not have the capacity to care for them. Our job is to provide a safe space for those animals to go when the situation arises. Rehome or Adopt animals through us.</p>
<p>We are a judgement free rescue, taking animals in with no questions asked. Rest assured that your animal will be taken care of with us.</p>

<p>Not all rescues remain in our facilities. Species we do not have experts to care for are relocated to a wildlife center or sanctuary who can provide the best quality of life to the animal.</p>
